# HR-ATTRITION-CASE-STUDY--IIIT
Develop a model to identify whether a employee will leave a company or not.

#                                                 Business Understanding


 Basically in large companies, employee count will affect the business drastically . If a new employee enters the organisation,there needs to be a initial understanding about the business and internal logistics.Lot of KT and several trainings has to be given to the employees inorder to make them productive.If an employee leave the company, they need to be replaced with the talent pool available 
 in the job market and also the projects and their timelines will get delayed which leads to a reputation loss among consumers and partners as well as the money.So, we are developing a model which will predict the probability of employee attrition, 
 which helps company to be proactive.

                                      Logistic Regression With STEPAIC.

#                                                  Conclusion

                         Our Logistic Regression model is able to predict with 81% accuracy.
                                  Sensitivity is more important to us.
         Sensitivity  of our model is 81% i.e. it correctly identifies 81% of employees which are likely to leave the company.
        Specificity of our model is 80% i.e. it correctly identifies 80% of employees which are not likely to leave the company.
               KS Statistics for the model is 54% which indicates our model is fairly good and accurate.

#                                        Recommendations are as follows:
                   Company should takes some actions to improve work life balance of employees.
    Working environment should be improved. Employees should get regular breaks. Quizes and indoor games should be promoted.
                            Managers should not be changed very frequently.
             For Frequently traveling employees, company should take some steps to keep them in our company.
